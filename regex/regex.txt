#https://regexland.com/all-between-specified-characters/
#A regular expression that matches all characters between two specified characters makes use of look-ahead (?=…) and look-behind (?<=…) statements to isolate the string, and then uses the dot character . to #select all contents between the delimiters.
#An expression that does matches everything between a and b is:

/(?<=a).*(?=b)/g
